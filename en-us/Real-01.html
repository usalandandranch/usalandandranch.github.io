                <p>Excellent meat processor, smokehouse, and retail store near Camp Wood, TX and the beautiful Nueces River. This business was built by the owner and finished in early 2012, and sits among beautiful trees right on the highway between Camp Wood and Uvalde to the south. The real estate is 1.88 acres with 300 feet of frontage on State Highway 55. The concrete pad is 3,755 square feet and has 2,629 square feet under refrigeration. Refrigeration sits behind the main store and the attic is floored for storage.</p>
                <p>Nueces Country Smokehouse was started by a longtime grocery meat market executive and his attention to detail in designing this facility is outstanding. No space is wasted with wrap around porch for smoking meats to picnic tables for enjoying the best food in Real County. Entering the ADA compliant store are 2 aisles for groceries then the 12 foot display case with fresh foods, prepared meats and side dishes, and freshly smoked meats. Behind that you see the butchers grinding meats, smoking meats, cutting steaks and roasts and making sausages and jerky. A large drink cooler on one side and fresh food grill complete the main floor. Workers, businessmen, hunters and fishermen, and travelers all stop here for lunch and dinner at the grill which serves an excellent hamburger with fresh ground chuck, sliced or chopped brisket from their smoker, pulled pork, ham, and bacon all smoked on-site. In addition they serve rotisserie chicken and pork and their hand made sausages and jerkies. Side dishes are homemade as are desserts!</p>
                <p>Deer processing is big in this area and Nueces Country Smokehouse continues to grow that business. Cooler is big enough to handle 40 carcasses of deer at one time and freezer is 6x8 for frozen storage. Visitors to this store are tourists, locals, river enthusiasts, hunters, bikers, and motorcyclists. The east-west crossroad in Camp Wood is State Highway 337 and it is one of the famous “Twisted Sisters” that motorcyclists loved to drive. The other business growing here is catering as this store is into its fourth year of business the word is getting out about the fabulous food prepared here. Large ranches, family reunions, weddings, and other venues are calling on Nueces Country Smokehouse to “knock them out” with great food and service.</p>
                <p>All water and septic rights, and TABC and cigarette licenses can be transferrable. The list price of the business, real estate, inventory, equipment, and customer lists is $749,000. This business is on track to net well over $100,000 this year and is just finishing its 4th year of operation.

Employees are skilled and ready to stay in an ownership change, and owner will transition with the buyer. This is an ideal business venture for young families ready to move into a small town with a great school system, early retirees ready to get into the beautiful Hill Country of Texas, or empty nesters to take on the new profitable adventure in their lives.</p>
