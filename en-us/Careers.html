                                <h4>Real Estate Agent</h4>
                                <br>
                                <p><b>THE OPPORTUNITY:</b>  We are seeking licensed real estate agents, experienced or new, to join our growing team.  The professionals at USA Land and Ranch, LLC have unlimited earning potential.  As a member of our team, you have the ability to determine your own hours, your own schedule, and your own income level.  Want to join them?  The first step is moving out of a role that works for someone else and stepping into a role that works for yourself.  This is a 1099 contract position with 100% ability to earn as much or as little as you would like.  Part-time or full-time availability.  With the ability to learn the real estate industry from the ground level up, you can set yourself on a career path that will carry you far beyond the average 9-5 grind.  This is a unique opportunity to join an established company on the ground-level as it begins its expansion.</p>

                                <p><b>THE COMPANY:</b>  USA Land and Ranch, LLC is a small real estate brokerage and auction house.  The company was founded in 2013 by a single individual and is quickly growing into a dynamic team environment.  Its small size provides a number of benefits that larger realty groups cannot compete with.  The primary focus of the group is customer service and overall client satisfaction, something frequently overlooked in the results-by-volume approach taken by our competitors.</p>

                                <p><b>THE MARKET:</b>  Amarillo, TX; Texas Panhandle; Surrounding areas; Texas</p>

                                <p><b>THE SUPPORT:</b>  An agent can only care for their clients if they are cared for themselves.  Each agent receives individual focus.  This focus allows the agent to assist their clients with the knowledge that they have a team supporting them.  With significantly lower than average broker fees, more of the agent’s commission stays in their own pocket rather than going to someone else.  A full back office system is provided for the use of the agents, a CRM system, marketing tools and the assistance of an administrative staff.</p>

                                <p><b>THE IDEAL CANDIDATE:</b>  Bright, ambitious, hard-working, driven to succeed, passionate about helping others, must have an entrepreneurial spirit, friendly, team-player and willing to focus on customer service.</p>

                                <p><b>THE QUALIFICATIONS:</b>  Active Texas Real Estate License</p>
