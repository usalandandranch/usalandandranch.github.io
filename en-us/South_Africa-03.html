                <p>On the N2 main road</p> 
                <p>$3,600,000.00 ($1,332.00 / acre)</p> 
                <p>2702 Acres</p> 
                <p>Situated on the N2 main road near the Zululand Rhino Reserve. This property is totally boundary fenced and electrified. Very well stocked with local natural game including buffalo, giraffe, zebra and a whole list more.</p>

                <p>There are two modern lodges on this property with the sleeping capacity of 95 people. There are also two “Lapa’s” ( luxury entertainment areas) 2 swimming pools and all the amenities needed to make it unforgetfull. This is truly a unique chance to invest in a property that will keep the guests coming back again and again while it affords the owner to hunt and also to have a substantial income.</p>

                <p>The variety of game on this property is the main attraction to the tourists who number average for the past 8 years to be 10,000 per year creating a very lucrative income.</p>

                <p>This is one of the most attractive properties to buy as a going concern and the biggest draw card is the fact that there is a possibility that the fence between it and the Phinda Game Reserve could be dropped which will make this a Big 5 Game Park immediately.</p>

                <p>A cold room with a process barn and all the buildings for staff housing maintenance and services are in place.</p>

                <p>Truly an investors / hunters dream to have his own place and to have a great income.</p>
