                <p><b>Size: </b> 3,115 acres $741 per ac / 1246 hectares in size.</p> 
                <p><b>Information: </b>This 1246ha portion of Big 5 property is a private wildlife reserve located in the Balule reserve, in the South African Lowveld. It is a big 5 reserve, adjoining and open to the Klaserie game reserve and the bigger Kruger National Park. This exclusive and privately owned reserve is an undeveloped reserve and is home to the undisturbed natural beauty and wildlife of the Lowveld.</p>
                <p>This wildlife reserve is 1246 hectares in size, and to the south of its borders, is the Olifants River Game reserve and on the eastern side Klaserie game reserve.</p>
                <p>The more than 50km of gravel and grass game drive trails crosses through the reserve and have been carefully planned to not disturb the pristine nature and wildlife. 2 solar powered water holes provide relief for wildlife that passes through. 5km to the north flows the Olifants river to the east coast and to the south of the reserve is “Double dam” that is fed from storm water run-off.</p>
                <p><b>Environment: </b>The vegetation is a mix of different plant domains with the dominant tree groups thorn trees (acacia), marula, combretums (red bush family), commiphoras (cork wood) and tambotie. Shrubs and smaller bushes make valuable grazing for some species and many different grass species cover the open ground during a good season.</p>
                <p>The soil type typically has weathered granite, sandy and rocky composition. The soil is rich in mica containing deposits and in the south west of the reserve deposits of soaprock is found. Historical pots and tools have been found on this reserve. Towards the north the soil becomes rocky and hard with weathered mineral deposits. The ground can support dense grass and shrub vegetation growth during good rainfall seasons. Rocky outcrops, koppies and little hills are evident with most of the topography evidently shaped by water and run-off.</p>
                <p>A few dry runs crosses the reserve which become alive during a good rain storm. These finally drain into the Olifants river to the north. The dry river beds contain subsurface water which the elephant and other wildlife extract when necessary. Bordering the river beds, are big and beautiful trees – Tambotie, wild fig, weeping boer bean, combretums, nyala tree and many others.</p>
                <p>The reserve is situated in a summer rainfall area and is subtropical. Summer days can be hot and humid with temperature at time exceeding 38°C. Dry season is typically during May to August and is an excellent time to view wildlife as water is restricted to rivers and water holes, where the wildlife congregates. Rain season normally starts October and carries through to April. This area can experience heavy rain down pours. Summer (October to March) is lovely due to the rains - everything is lush and green, and the birding is excellent. November and December are the calving months.</p>
                <p><b>Wildlife: </b>The Reserve is home to the famous big 5 where lion, leopard, elephant, rhino and buffalo co-exist. Common sightings are elephant, giraffe, zebra, buffalo, warthog, rhino, lion, spotted hyaena, baboon, hippo, impala, kudu, vervet monkey, waterbuck, wildbeest, bushbaby, mongoose, duiker, steenbok, klipspringer, genet, bats. With planning and good judgment you should also not miss leopard, bat-eared fox, honey badger, porcupine, aardvark, aardwolf, civet, caracal, serval, suni.</p>
                <p>It is home to the big 6 birds – lappet-faced vulture, martial eagle, saddle-billed stork, kori bustard, ground hornbill. Birds are abundant and common sightings are vultures, owls, bee-eaters, rollers, eagles, bustards, hornbills, starlings, shrikes and other rare wildlife.</p>
                <p>This reserve is incorporated into the Greater Olifants River Conservancy, as one of 5 conservancies of Balule (others being Olifants West Game Reserve, York Game Reserve, Parsons, Grietjie game reserve and Olifants North Game Reserve). This reserve is situated southwest of Phalaborwa, and north of Hoedspruit. The name Balule is the Shangaan word for "Buffalo". Balule Nature Reserve adjoins the Klaserie Nature Reserve and is further included in the bigger Kruger National Park, in the Limpopo province of South Africa.</p>
