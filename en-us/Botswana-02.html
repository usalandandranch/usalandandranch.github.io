                <p><b>Central Kalahari Game Reserve: </b>The Central Kalahari Game Reserve (52 000m²) is the second largest game reserve in the world.  It is home to large animal populations.  The department of wildlife and national parks does not wish to allow the development of lodges within the Central Kalahari Game Reserve but wishes to keep it as a true wilderness area.</p>
                <p><b>Landscape: </b>In the southern Kalahari area the sand lies in distinct linear dunes. These dunes are covered in grass, shrubs and trees.  In contrast with true sand deserts, the sand in the Kalahari is stabilized by vegetation.</p>
                <p><b>Rainfall: </b> Although the Kalahari is generally seen as a desert, it is in actual fact e semi-arid savannah, with average rainfall at the lodge of 300 mm per annum. Rainfall is one of the main ecological driving forces in this area. It determines the quantity of plant growth produced each year and the amount of food for game. The quantity and distribution of rainfall through the wet periods is also important. If for example it rains early in the season certain grass and tree species are favoured. Should it rain at a later stage totally different species are favoured and this phenomena will give the eco-tourist a totally different experience of the Kalahari every season.</p>
