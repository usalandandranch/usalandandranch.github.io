    										<p>
    											Having been directly involved with very many properties being developed and remodeled for resale and improving the value of such with the knowledge of costs and prices to do so it has been of much benefit to many buyers and investors. Developing and planning improvements on different properties is not a one plan fits all.
    										</p>
    										<p>
    											Each property needs a plan of strategy to achieve the long , medium or short term goal in capital spending versus capital gain and gain on investment.
    										</p>
    										<p>
    											We do consulting for landowners on their long term planning and distribution once we know their plans and goals that they would like to achieve and how to best get it accomplished.
    										</p>
    										<p>
    											We also do consultation and management for absentee owners on a month to month basis as per their requirement.
    										</p>
    										<p>
    											The consultation also pertains to people who are looking to buy hunting land, recreational land, productive farming land which could be leased out to create income, CRP program land which is earning by way of Government payments and land bought for long term investments. Many times it is just the plain cattle ranches that are the long term stable investment properties that are the foundation of portfolio building. Those cattle ranches are the ones when leased to cattle men, which are the best looked after over a long period of time and people who have a interest in the land and do not simply do any changes by way of roads, ponds, clearings and buildings which is not in the best interest of the land.
    										</p>
    										<p>
    											Through our vast knowledge of Texas we are able to advise buyers and investors on land and properties in such a way without having any bias to any one area or location.
    										</p>
    										<p>
    											Many buyers or sellers agents do not always exhibit the best interest for their clients in advising them on very important issues and a small number truly have the farming and ranching background experience of the industry before they became real estate agents. Having been in management of large farming and ranching operations for 18 years has truly put us in a position of knowledge and expertise when it does come to advising land investors on what they are looking at, knowing what their goals are. 
    										</p>
    										<p>
    											We have had the privilege of working very close with one investor and have bought and sold many properties for him and can confidently report that over time that it was a very financial benefit for him. We also undertook the oversight of the improvements on the properties on his behalf. 
    										</p>
    										<p>
    											With the ease of looking up everything on the internet these days most people think that they immediately know all of how to do stuff especially when it comes to unregulated things as owning land and buying it since they are financially able to do so, go out and doing some improvements and then find out that they made some mistakes along the way in not doing the needed research or having the knowledge of what they were doing. Being able to pay for it does not always make you a professional at what you are busy with. 
    										</p>
    										<p>
    											It is with much respect to the land and the creation of it, that we offer our services in consultation on any issues pertaining to purchasing, selling and improvement and management of land to you as a buyer, seller or investor. 
    										</p>
    										<p>
    											As the slogan goes that everything must be "Politically Correct " that in that light we offer you our services that we always undertake to be "Truthfully Correct" in all we do and say.

                                <p>In addition to Recreational, Farming and Ranch land, USA Land and Ranch Realty is looking for investors and/or developers who are interested in solar farm projects. We can procure land for you by way of either purchase or leasing. </p>                             
                                <p>Having an agricultural background, Dirk van Reenen is able to find common ground and acceptance more easily with farms and ranchers and facilitate negotiations with them at terms and conditions beneficial to all parties. His agricultural background helps him foster understand and trust with land owners. </p>
                                <p>Dirk recently successfully negotiated and obtained the executive rights of the minerals for a solar farm project consisting of 1,000 acres of land in the rolling hills of Texas. Not all of the mineral rights owners were surface owners, adding to the complexity of the project. However, Dirk's knowledge and expertise resulted in the procurement of the land for the developer. </p>
