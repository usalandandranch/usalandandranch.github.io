                <p>This 675 acre property is a rear opportunity as it is very well suited to cattle and also a hunters dream. Well fenced and does have some cropland which has been fallowed for the past year. There are 3 very large ponds on this property of which one is spring fed and does not go dry and is also the largest. Fishing takes place by way of a boat on it. There is a 1 bedroom cabin on this property and a very good set of cattle corrals with a cattle scale and a barn. With the spring fed pond this is the big attraction to wildlife in the area and they come from a big area to water at this pond. 25% Minerals sell with this property or could be negotiated.</p>
