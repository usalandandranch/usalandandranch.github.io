                <p><b>Topography: </b>Total amazement when I set foot on this property. The vistas is indescribable, the beauty of Nature is indescribable, the deep 120m gorges is indescribable..... I find it difficult to but the true beauty on paper or on camera. This farm took my breath away. The farm seems mountainous but yet, there is only 40% mountains and the rest is flat to rolling and very accessible.</p>
                <p>There are deep deep rocky gorges (ideal to do ab-sailing) with rock pool after rock pool after rock pool. Waterfalls, raptures and again waterfalls... tame game, good accommodation. This is not the garden of Eden, but it is a close representation of how is must have been. This beautiful Waterberg savannah and speaks to your heart and soul.</p>
