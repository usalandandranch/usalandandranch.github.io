This property is as the crow flies only about 2/3 miles south of the South Pease river. There are turkey, hogs. Quail have begun coming in because of the good grass cover. Included in the sale is 3 Deer feeders and 3 hunting blinds. As this property does have some annual income and is a good hunting place it makes for a good investment and is also a perfect Weekend Getaway. This is truly a gem of a property and this type does not come on the market very often.",
